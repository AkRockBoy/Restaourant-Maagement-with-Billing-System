# Restaourant-Maagement-with-Billing-System
The Project Restaurant Management System is a software application developed using the Python programming language and the Tkinter graphical user interface toolkit. The aim of the project is to create a comprehensive system for managing various aspects of a restaurant, including table management, order management, menu management, and billing.

The software application allows the restaurant staff to manage tables and take orders from customers. The orders can be customized based on the customer's preferences, and the system automatically updates the inventory of ingredients used for preparing the dishes. The menu can be modified as needed, and the system provides analytics on the most popular dishes and ingredients used.

One of the key features of the system is the billing system, which calculates the total cost of each order based on the menu items selected and any applicable discounts or promotions. The system also generates detailed invoices for customers, which can be printed or emailed to them.

Overall, the Project Restaurant Management System provides a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of a restaurant's operations, making it easier for staff to efficiently serve customers and manage their business.
